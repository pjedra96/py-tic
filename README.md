# Py-Tic
A GUI-based simple Tic Tac Toe game written in Python. There are two different versions, one developed in the Object Oriented way and the classic functional programming. The tic_object.py is OO-based, and uses tkinter library for its graphical interface. The other tic.py is written in a functional manner, and uses pygame library. Currently the game only allows a 2 player (1v1) gameplay, and does not include an option of playing against a computer- the AI-assisted gameplay option may be developed in the future.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository (https://www.github.com/pjedra96/py-tic) to a directory of your choice.
2. Ensure that you have Python3 installed on your system.
3. Execute `py tic.py` or `py tic_object.py` from the Command Prompt at the root of the repository clone. You should see a list of console output in the terminal window as the app launches, and a Pygame GUI window with the game.
